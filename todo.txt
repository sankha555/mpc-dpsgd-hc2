- plot graphs for all mno-privacy case for larger number of epochs and check where the accuracy starts dropping
- limit epsilon to smalkler values and get the results
- perhaps this network is not correct network in no-privacy case either

1. If the accuracy doesnt oncrease by a lot (say 0.5 % ) after some epochs, stop training there. Don't go over 10 in any case, because not much increase in the accuracy after this for such networks.
2. Get the largest possible batch size which trains well in the non-privacy case and check the accuracy for the same batch size in prvacy case. Identify such a network.
3. Limit epsilon value to 4.
4. Once such a network is identified, add the minimum possible noise level and show the deviation in accuracy from vanilla.
